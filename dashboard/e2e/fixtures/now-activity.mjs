 * world.mjs are, and it may apply a base fixture first (`import { FIXTURES as BASE } from "./world.mjs"`, then
 * `BASE["l01-running"](world)`). index.mjs registers this map
 * once, through `registerFixtures`; a name already registered (a base fixture's or another package's) fails the import,
 * so no package shadows another. Screen packages add fixtures here only, never in world.mjs or operations.mjs.
